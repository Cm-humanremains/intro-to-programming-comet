    <h3>About</h3>

      <p>My name is Chris. 
       The best time of my life has been right now. Being out of work and taking care of my two kids has only furthered my desire to become a better more experienced human being.
       I am a current student of Code The Dream and on my way to becoming a junior software developer. 
       I am excited to use these new skills in a way that will inspire others around me. 
       My life motto is : ‚ÄúIf  I can learn to do it, then so can you‚Äù. 

    <h3>Experience</h3>

    <h4>Work History </h4>
        <p>File Clerk @ Cardiologist Office</p>
        <p>Custodian @ a College</p> 
        <p>Library Associate @ a Public Library</p>
        <p>Intern @ a Public Works Facility</p>
        <p>Researcher @ an Economic Development Corp.</p>
        <p>Financial Analyst @ a National Defense Contractor </p>
        <p>Purchasing Director @ Construction Company</p>
        <p>Through all that experience, the most important thing I learned is that when we value people over profit, amazing things can happen üòâ</p>


    <h4>Coding Projects</h4>
        <p>Javascript Drum Kit from @ <a href="https://javascript30.com"> javascript30</a>. This will create a few keybaord keys and attach different drum sounds to them. </p>
        <p>Speech Synthesizer also from @ <a href="https://javascript30.com"> javascript30</a>. This is really neat. This will take text input and have the computer say the text back through your speakers.</p>
        <p>Video Game addon for Elder Scrolls Online. The add on will help add colorblind accessibility so my stepfather can see his surroundings better when we play together. </p>
        <p>This wonderful webpage which will also showcase all of my final completed coding projects</p>
